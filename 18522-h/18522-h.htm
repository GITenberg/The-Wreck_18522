<div class="figleft" style="width: 337px;">
<img src="images/p004-s.jpg" width="337" height="425" alt="The Swing" title="The Swing" />
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 4em;">llie had
been swinging
for
nearly an
hour in the
grove behind
the old
farm-house,
when she
heard her
mother's
voice calling,
"Ollie,
Ollie! where are you, child?" Ollie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>stopped swinging and listened. "That
is mamma," she said; "I must run
quickly and see what she wants."
So, jumping down and leaving the
swing to "die away" by itself, she
skipped along the path which led up
to the back door. Her mother was
standing on the step, holding a basket
in her hand. When she saw Ollie
she said, "Ah, here you are; I have
been looking for you all over the
house."</p>

<p>"I have been swinging, and only
just heard you calling," answered
Ollie. "Do you want me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Rogers; "I want
some more sugar. I thought we had
plenty, but these new cookies that
Mrs. Coe told me about do take a
great deal more than my old ones.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>So, go as quickly as you can, my
dear, for I am dreadfully bothered
for the want of it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Ollie, taking the basket;
"I will not be a minute.
Couldn't Willie go with me? See, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>is looking through the window. I
am sure a little walk would do him
good."</p>



<p>"No, not yet," said Mrs. Rogers.
"The doctor says he must not leave
the house before next week. Now
run along."</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/p006-s.jpg" width="376" height="347" alt="Willie" title="Willie" />
</div></div>

<p>Ollie threw a kiss toward the window
and started down the path.
She was just going to open the gate
when she heard a "rat-tat-tat" behind
her.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 299px;">
<img src="images/p008-s.jpg" width="299" height="482" alt="Ollie" title="Ollie" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></div></div>

<p>"Willie wants something, I am
sure," she said, turning back again;
"I wonder what it is! He is pointing
under that bush, but I do not
see anything. Ah, here you are, you
rogue! it is you who are wanted;"
and she pulled out a great big black
rabbit, Willie's especial pet. "It is
just as well that I have to go to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
house again, for I forgot my sun-umbrella,
and I am sure the day is
very hot."</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">
<img src="images/p010-s.jpg" width="300" height="370" alt="The pet rabbit" title="The pet rabbit" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>The sun-umbrella to which Ollie
alluded was one of her birthday presents,
and she was always glad when
the sun was hot enough to make it
useful. The rabbit being laid in Willie's
lap, Ollie started off once more,
running as fast as she could to make
up for lost time. In a few minutes she
reached the village. The sugar was
soon bought and tucked away in the
basket.</p>

<p>Ollie ran along, and was just hesitating
whether she should climb the fence
and run through Squire Thompson's
lot, or go around by the road, when
she saw, just before her, Lucy Coit,
walking along with her school-books in
her bag.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 302px;">
<img src="images/p012-s.jpg" width="302" height="525" alt="Lucy" title="Lucy" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There is Lucy," said Ollie; "I
wonder what she is doing with her bag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
of books at this time of day. I will
run up and ask her."</p>

<p>Ollie soon overtook her schoolmate,
and putting her arm around her waist
they walked on together.</p>

<p>"I could not imagine what you were
carrying your school-books for," said
Ollie. "You can't have been kept
after school, for you always know your
lessons so well."</p>

<p>"No," said Lucy, "I wasn't kept
after, but I stayed myself. I couldn't
get a sum in fractions right, and Miss
Palmer said if I would wait till every
one had gone she would show me about
it. Now I know it, and I am going
down to the beach. Don't you want
to go too?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Ollie; "but I must
take this sugar to mamma first. Let's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
climb over these bars and cut across
this field. It is a great deal <ins class="correction" title="Original read 'shorer'.">shorter</ins>
than by the road."</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/p015-s.jpg" width="376" height="379" alt="Geese" title="Geese" />
</div></div>

<p>There were some geese in the field,
which evidently did not like to have
their privacy intruded upon, for they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
set up a terrible quacking as the children
passed them. Ollie and Lucy,
however, quacked back again, and the
geese soon left them and continued to
nibble away at the grass.</p>

<p>Ollie soon reached her home, and
leaving her basket on the table she ran
up-stairs to find her mother, for she
wanted permission to go to the
beach.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mrs. Rogers, "you may
go; but it looks a little showery, and
I don't want you to get wet. Watch
the clouds, and if you see a storm
coming, hurry home, so as to get in
before the rain."</p>

<p>Ollie promised to do as she was told
and kissing her mother good-by she
ran down-stairs. She found Lucy
standing by the fence, looking over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
into Mr. Beech's yard. Mr. Beech
lived next to Ollie's papa, and he had
one little girl. Every one called her
"Chubby," because she was so plump
and round.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 377px;">
<img src="images/p017-s.jpg" width="377" height="376" alt="Chubby" title="Chubby" />
</div></div>

<p>"Lucy," called Ollie, "what are you
doing?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come here a minute," said Lucy.</p>

<p>Ollie went to the fence, and there she
saw Chubby holding a basket full of
delicious ripe strawberries. "Why,
Chubby," said Ollie, "what are you
going to do with those lovely berries?
How good they look, don't they,
Lucy?"</p>

<p>"Oh," said Chubby, "I must be
very careful, for they do roll about so
that I can hardly carry them. You
may each have one, but I cannot spare
more, because they are for my tea-party."</p>

<p>So Chubby passed the basket very
carefully to the children, while each
one helped herself, and then she started<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
to walk carefully over the grass toward
a seat under a big tree.</p>

<p>"And what is your party?" asked
Lucy. "It must be a very nice one, I
think, if you have such things as those
to eat."</p>

<p>"Oh, there it is," said Chubby; and
looking in the direction of her finger
the children saw a table covered with
a white cloth, and a pretty blue tea-set
upon it.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 565px;">
<img src="images/p020-s.jpg" width="565" height="371" alt="The tea-party" title="The tea-party" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>They had evidently been very hungry
when they began the feast, for not
a crumb remained upon one of the
plates, and three little girls were sitting
there, waiting patiently for a fresh
supply of good things. Ollie and Lucy
watched Chubby till she set her plate
of berries safely upon the table, and
then, turning around, they remembered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
that they had only a short time to stay
at the beach, and that consequently
they had better not lose any more time
in loitering by the way.</p>

<p>It was only a quarter of a mile from
Ollie's house to the water, and it did
not take long to get over the ground
which lay between. Ollie was never
tired of the ocean, and it was a rare
thing for her to let a day pass without
spending some time on the shore.</p>

<p>Some one was there before them, and
at first the children could not imagine
whom it could be; but as they drew
nearer they saw that it was Miss Palmer,
their teacher. She had thrown off
her hat, and was reading so earnestly
that she neither saw nor heard the
children till they were close upon her.</p>

<p>Miss Palmer was very much beloved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
by all of her scholars, and they thought
nothing a greater treat than to sit
by her side and listen while she told
them stories or talked to them. So
when our two little friends saw who it
was, they ran and sat down, one on
each side of her.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/p023-s.jpg" width="376" height="411" alt="Mrs. Palmer" title="Mrs. Palmer" />
</div></div>

<p>Miss Palmer looked up, and upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
seeing who it was that had interrupted
her she closed her book, and said she
was just wishing she had some one to
talk to.</p>

<p>"Do you notice how still it is?" she
said, "and how close and hot the air is?
I fear we are going to have a terrible
storm. We must watch the clouds,
and run a race with them. If we get
home first, all will be well, but if the
clouds do, alas for our clothes!"</p>

<p>Just as she spoke they heard a low
muttering of thunder, and then suddenly
a blast of cold wind rushed by them.
The big black clouds rolled rapidly
up, and in a moment the whole scene
before them was changed. The ocean<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
began to have a lowering, angry look,
and a schooner which had been lying
lazily in the water gave a bound forward
like a live creature, and sped on
its way. Miss Palmer sprang to her
feet, saying, "Now, children, the time
for the race has come. The rain is determined
to get there first, but so are
we; see who will win the race."</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/p025-s.jpg" width="376" height="417" alt="The schooner" title="The schooner" />
</div></div>

<p>So all three started on at a quick<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
pace. One big drop fell on Lucy's
hand, and they hurried on. The race
was barely theirs, for just as they
stepped in at the door a blinding flash
of lightning came, and a crash of thunder
almost at the same instant, which
made them glad enough that they were
safely housed.</p>

<p>Although the thunder and lightning
ceased after a while, and even the rain
poured itself out, the wind continued
to blow furiously. Lucy waited till she
dared wait no longer, and then said
that she must go home, for she knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
her mother was already anxious about
her.</p>

<p>"Oh, you can't go, Lucy," said Ollie;
"see how that great tree bends;
why, you couldn't keep on your feet
for one minute."</p>

<p>Just then they looked out of the
window and saw Ollie's father riding
by. He had just stopped to speak to
some one, and Ollie, losing no time,
opened the window and called to him.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 376px;">
<img src="images/p028-s.jpg" width="376" height="464" alt="Ollie&#39;s father" title="Ollie&#39;s father" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Papa, papa," she called, "do you
think it is safe for Lucy to try to go
home?"</p>

<p>The wind was making such a terrible
noise that Ollie's voice could not be
heard.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers dismounted and came to
the window. He did not think it at all
safe for Lucy to go home in such a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
gale, and promised instead to go to
Mr. Coit's house and beg permission
for Lucy to stay all night with Ollie.</p>

<p>Of course both of the children were
overjoyed with this arrangement, and
begun at once to amuse themselves.
Ollie's papa soon came back, bringing
with him a bag for Lucy, which contained
everything that she could possibly
want during the night.</p>

<p>The wind, instead of abating, increased
in fury. It roared and
screamed about the house like an angry
wild beast. It caught up the clothes
which old Milly had spread upon the
grass to bleach, and whirled them round
and round in circles over the house,
and carried them off no one knew
where. It seized the old bucket which
hung in the well, and swung it back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
and forth with such force that no one
dared go near enough to fasten it.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock the children went to
bed, and in spite of the wind they
were soon sleeping soundly. All was
still within the house, and both Lucy
and Ollie were too much used to storms
on the sea-shore to be disturbed by
them.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 673px;">
<img src="images/p032-s.jpg" width="673" height="379" alt="Lucy wakes up Ollie" title="Lucy wakes up Ollie" />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
</div></div>

<p>Suddenly, however, Lucy started
from her bed. What was that sound?
surely it was the slamming of the
front door. While she was listening
she saw something which made her
heart beat fast. It was a rocket which
shot by her window. Another and another
followed. Lucy sprang out of
bed and began to dress. There was
hardly a child in Spehunket who did
not know the terrible meaning of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
rocket soaring into the air in the
dead of night.</p>

<p>Lucy hastily slipped on her clothes,
and then, going back to the bed, she
took Ollie's hand and called softly,</p>

<p>"Ollie, Ollie! wake up. There is a
wreck, and I think some of the people
have gone down to the beach. Don't
you want to go too?"</p>

<p>Ollie started up, looking frightened
at being so suddenly roused. "What
is it? what is it?" she asked excitedly.
"What is the matter?"</p>

<p>"There is a wreck, Ollie," said
Lucy, "and the men at the life-saving
station are hard at work. Oh, Ollie!
just think of the poor things clinging
to the ship, and expecting every moment
to go down! I must go down<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
there and see if I can't do something
to help."</p>

<p>By this time Ollie was wide awake,
and as interested as Lucy. It did not
take her long to dress, and in a few
minutes they went softly down-stairs.
Mrs. Rogers' bed-room door was open,
and upon looking in the children saw
that Ollie's papa and mamma had gone
to the beach. As there was no one of
whom they could ask permission, each
little girl wrapped herself warmly in a
woollen shawl, and drawing the bolt of
the kitchen door they stepped out into
the night.</p>

<p>It was two o'clock, and during the
six hours which had passed since they
went to bed the wind had abated in
force somewhat. The sky was full of
black, angry-looking clouds, but the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
moon was struggling to make herself
seen. On the whole, it was not a dark
night, and the children found no difficulty
whatever in seeing the well-worn
path which led through their field to
the beach. If they had been doubtful
of the way they would have been
guided by the bonfires, and by an occasional
rocket which shot up into the
air; but as it was they knew the road
well, and excepting when the moon
was hidden for a moment behind a
cloud, all was bright around them.</p>

<p>They soon reached the beach, and
were there just in time to see the men
from the station bring down the life-boat.
It was a hard pull through the
sand, but the feat was soon accomplished,
and the boat was left near the
water's edge, to be ready in case the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
line from the mortar should fail to
reach the wreck.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">
<img src="images/p037-s.jpg" width="422" height="373" alt="The Life-boat" title="The Life-boat" />
</div></div>

<p>The mortar was standing there, and
the men were preparing to send out
the line which was to bring succor to
the terrified passengers on the wreck.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
At the word of command the string
was pulled&mdash;"<i>Bang</i>," and off went the
line, curving through the air. Every
one watched in breathless anxiety to
see if it would reach the ship. Yes, on
it went, and then dropped down upon
the deck.</p>

<p>A shout of joy rose up from the
crowd upon the beach, and it must
have been answered by those on the
wreck, but every sound was lost in the
roaring of the wind and of the angry
waves. In an instant a stronger line
was attached, and to that, after being
drawn on board and securely fastened
to the mast, a little car was attached
and was quickly drawn on board. Into
this car one human being could get at
a time, and could be drawn over the
breakers safely to the shore.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p>The work of the night now began in
earnest. Back and forth went the car.
Sometimes it brought back a little
child, sometimes a papa or mamma,
and at last the sailors one by one, and
then, last of all, the faithful captain, who
would not leave his ship until he had
seen all his passengers and crew safely
on the land.</p>

<p>When they began working the car
Lucy and Ollie stood by looking on,
and longing to help those brave men.
But they were only little girls, and
what could they do?</p>

<p>"Ollie," said Lucy, "I have an
idea. Do you see that bonfire? It is
nearly out. If you will gather some
sticks and build it up again, I will run
back to your house, and get some coffee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
and a kettle. I think a cup of coffee
would refresh these men wonderfully."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Lucy," said Ollie, "run&mdash;run
quickly. Tell Milly to help you.
I saw Sambo here a moment ago&mdash;oh,
here he is. Sambo, Sambo, go back to
the house with Miss Lucy and help her
bring some things which she wants."</p>

<p>Lucy and Sambo were off in a hurry,
and as soon as they were gone Ollie
gathered all the drift-wood she could
find, and proceeded immediately to
brighten up the fire, which had nearly
died away. She worked steadily and
quietly, and by the time she had a
bright blaze Lucy reappeared with a
big package of coffee, a pot, and a pail
of water. They filled the pot and put
it over the fire and waited for it to
boil. It seemed a long time before the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
steam began to rise, but gradually it
became more and more dense, until at
last the cover of the pot began to
dance up and down, and the delightful
bubbling sound greeted their ears
which told that the water was boiling.</p>

<p>The coffee was already in the coffee-pot,
and in a short time the grateful
fragrance rose upon the air.</p>

<p>"Oh, oh," said Ollie, "we have
neither milk nor sugar!"</p>

<p>"I never thought of that," said
Lucy, in a disappointed tone, "but I
know they must have some at the lifesaving-station."</p>

<p>"I knows where they keeps it, miss,
for I used to be on the crew once,"
said Sambo; "I'll be back in a jiffy
with it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>So off went Sambo. The sugar was
found, but alas, there was no milk.</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Ollie; "they
must take it as it is. It will do them
just as much good."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>Now all this time the brave men of
the life-saving station had been hard
at work, drawing the car back and
forth, and they had just brought in the
captain, who, as I said, stood faithfully
by his ship until all on board had been
rescued, when some one shouted,</p>

<div class="center"><div class="figcenter" style="width: 396px;">
<img src="images/p042-s.jpg" width="396" height="376" alt="Man in the surf" title="Man in the surf" />
</div></div>

<p>"A man&mdash;a man in the surf!" They
rushed into the water and looked anxiously
before them. Yes, there he was,
clinging to a piece of the broken mast.
His strength was almost gone, and just
as a big wave was about to break over
him two strong pairs of hands seized
and dragged him almost exhausted to
the shore.</p>

<p>"Would you like some hot coffee?
Would you like some hot coffee?"</p>

<p>"What's that I hear about hot
coffee?" said one and another <ins class="correction" title="Original lacked the terminal period.">joyfully.</ins><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
"Hot coffee! why, who has been good
enough to think of that?"</p>

<p>"A cup of coffee would be a good
thing," said Joe Brown; "for the fact
is, I for one am just about beat out."</p>

<p>Lucy and Ollie were quite delighted
at the success of their undertaking, and
for the next half hour were busy
enough in pouring and passing the
coffee. Not only were the men of the
station thankful for a good drink, but
so were the poor tired and frightened
passengers; and the children had all
they could do to fill up the cups fast
enough.</p>

<p>They received a great many thanks
and a great many praises for their
thoughtfulness, and when they were
through the captain of the wrecked
steamer proposed three cheers for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
kind little girls who had done so much
to refresh them.</p>

<p>The cheers were hearty enough, and
the children were quite embarrassed to
have the attention of so many people
called to them. They felt quite repaid
for all their trouble when they saw
how refreshed every one looked after
taking a cup of their good hot coffee.</p>

<p>After a while the crowd began to
move on toward the station. The
crew rolled up their ropes and proceeded
to drag up the boat, which they
had not needed after all.</p>

<p>All were happy and thankful that no
lives had been lost, but the poor passengers
were rather melancholy at the
thought of probably losing all their
luggage. Every one was wet through,
and it was necessary that they should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
get on dry clothes as soon as possible.</p>

<p>All the houses in the village were
opened to the sufferers, and soon every
one was made comfortable. Clothing
of all sorts was lent them, for the
morrow, but in the mean time they were
glad to go to bed and get a good rest
and sleep.</p>

<p>Ollie and Lucy went back to bed
too, but no sleep came to them. They
talked until they saw the morning
dawn, and soon after sunrise they rose
and dressed for breakfast.</p>

<p>After breakfast they went down on
the beach again to look at the wreck,
and they spent a great deal of time
there watching it. A great many
efforts were made to save her, but all
in vain. One day, when the wind was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
unusually high, a great wave struck her
side, a crash was heard, and down she
went, out of sight forever, beneath the
waves.</p>

<p>"Now," said Lucy, "I suppose I
must go home. Mamma will be impatient
to see me and to know that I
am all right after the storm."</p>

<p>"And you want to see her too, I
have no doubt," said Ollie.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed I do, but I should like
to come back again. It is such fun to
have a girl of my own age to talk to;
but mamma has to be very busy this
week, and I must get back and help
her."</p>

<p>So Lucy walked toward the house.
She wanted to get her bag, and to
say good-by to Ollie's mamma.</p>

<p>The two children were talking so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
busily as they went along that they
did not notice a horse and wagon
standing at the gate of Mr. Rogers's
house, until they were close upon
it.</p>

<p>"Why, Ollie!" exclaimed Lucy;
"there is our horse; papa must have
come for me. I wonder if we have
kept him waiting!"</p>

<p>The children hurried in, and were
soon in the sitting-room, where, to
their surprise, they found Mr. and
Mrs. Coit, talking very busily.</p>

<p>"Oh, mamma!" said Lucy, running
forward to get a good-morning kiss,
"have you come for me? It was too
bad to keep you waiting; I will be
ready in one minute."</p>

<p>"I have not come to take you
away," said Mrs. Coit, "but to beg<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
Mrs. Rogers to keep you a little longer."</p>

<p>"Ah, Miss Lucy," said Ollie, laughing,
"you see they have found it so
pleasant to be without you that they
are going to give you to us."</p>

<p>Lucy looked from one to another in
surprise. "What do you mean, mamma?"
she asked; "am I to stay
here? what for? how long?"</p>

<p>"I will tell you," said her mother.
"Just after Mr. Rogers left our
house with your bag, last night, your
father brought a letter from the post-office
from your Aunt Mary. She is
going to move out West, and wants us
to go on and make her a visit before
she leaves. We are going to take Willie,
for I think a change of air would
do him good, after his illness; but your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
aunt's house is so small, I do not think
it is best for you to go. As Mrs. Rogers
has consented to keep you, I think
you had better stay here."</p>

<p>"Oh, good, good, good!" exclaimed
Ollie, clapping her hands and jumping
around the room for joy. "Now you
will have to stay, and be my sister for
a good long week."</p>

<p>Lucy hardly knew whether to be
glad or sorry. She was delighted to
stay with her friend, but the thought
of being so long away from her mamma
made her feel almost homesick.</p>

<p>"I will write you a letter every
day," said Mrs. Coit, seeing the cloud
on her little girl's face.</p>

<p>But the cloud only stayed a minute.
"After all," she thought, "mamma
will only be gone for a week, and I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
would much rather be here with Ollie
than at Aunt Mary's, where there
is no one of my own age; and a letter
every day! oh, that will be <i>too</i>
delightful!"</p>

<p>"Well, I must go," said Mrs. Coit.
"Thank you very much, Mrs. Rogers,
for taking Lucy; I hope she will
be a good child, and not give you
any trouble. Good-by."</p>

<p>"Martha will send over your trunk
this afternoon," she continued to
Lucy. "It is all packed, and William
Henry Johnson said he'd bring it over
on his way to the mill this evening.
Good-by, my dear," and Lucy was
seized, hugged, and kissed, and almost
before she knew what it was all about
her mother had gone, and she was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
left alone, watching the wagon as it
rolled slowly down the road.</p>

<p>She was roused by hearing Ollie's
voice close behind her.</p>

<p>"Oh, Lucy, let's go up-stairs, and
get the room ready for you. I must
move the things in my closet, and
make enough bare nails for your
dresses."</p>

<p>So the two girls went up-stairs together,
and the afternoon was passed
in preparations for the coming week.</p>

<p>The next morning Lucy and Ollie
went to school as usual, only instead of
having a long solitary walk, they each
had the other's company, which they
found very pleasant. The girls at
school were quite astonished to hear
that they were spending the week together.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>As they were walking back from
school, they saw on the beach the signal
which was always used to show
that there were fish in sight.</p>

<p>"Oh, let us hurry through our dinner,"
said Ollie, "and go down to the
beach. I love to see them draw in
their big nets full of fish. It is such
fun."</p>

<p>Mrs. Rogers was astonished to see
two wild children rush into the house,
all out of breath, exclaiming,</p>

<p>"Isn't dinner ready? We are in
such a hurry to get down to the
beach."</p>

<p>"Yes, dinner is ready," said Mrs.
Rogers; "you can sit down as soon as
you like."</p>

<p>As soon as they had eaten as much
as they wanted, and had been excused,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
they rushed to the beach. The men
were just preparing to launch the big
boat through the surf. When the children
came in sight, the captain of the
crew saw them and said,</p>

<p>"Hold up a minute; here are our little
friends; they always enjoy a dance
on the waves; let's wait, and take them
in."</p>

<p>So they beckoned to the children, and
in a few minutes they were seated in
the boat. The word of command was
given, and off they went&mdash;now up on
the top of the wave, now down, down,
down.</p>

<p>They had an unusually good haul of
fish, which the men insisted was all
owing to the presence of the two little
girls. They stayed on the beach or in the
boat all the afternoon, and finally went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
home to supper so hungry that Mrs.
Rogers laughingly declared that she
could not possibly cook enough in one
day to satisfy them.</p>

<p>Mrs. Coit kept her promise and
wrote to Lucy every day, and between
her letters and her good times with
Ollie, the days passed so quickly that
Lucy was surprised to find at last that
the hour for her departure had arrived.</p>

<p>"How little we thought that day
when I walked home with you that I
was to be here a week!"</p>

<p>"I wish we were going to have it all
over again," said Ollie.</p>

<p>"So do I," said Lucy.</p>

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
